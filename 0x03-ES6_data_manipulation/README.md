## Introduction

ES6, also known as ECMAScript 2015, introduced several new features and enhancements to JavaScript. These features provide more efficient and concise ways to manipulate data, making your code cleaner and more readable. In this learning project, we will cover some of the most commonly used data manipulation techniques offered by ES6.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:


- The `examples/` directory contains example code snippets that demonstrate the usage of various ES6 data manipulation techniques.
- The `src/` directory contains the source code files where you can implement your own ES6 data manipulation functions.
- The `tests/` directory contains test files to validate the correctness of your implementations.
- The `README.md` file provides information about the project and serves as the documentation you're currently reading.

## Getting Started

## Introduction

Unit testing is an essential practice in software development that involves testing individual units (functions, methods, etc.) of code to ensure their correctness and reliability. This repository provides hands-on examples of writing and running unit tests using Mocha for back-end JavaScript applications.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you should have the following tools and technologies installed:

- Node.js: [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/sethdanny/alx-backend-javascript/0x06-unit-tests-js.git

### Navigate to the project directory:

Copy code
cd 0x06-unit-tests-js
Install project dependencies:

Copy code
npm install
Usage
Run unit tests using Mocha:

Copy code
npm test
View the test results in the terminal. The tests will be executed based on the test files located in the test directory.

### Test Structure
The tests are organized using the Mocha testing framework in the test directory. Each test file contains test cases for specific functionalities.

Example test file structure:

plaintext
Copy code
test/
├── test-example.js
├── ...
Example test case structure:

javascript
Copy code

```
const assert = require('assert');
const exampleModule = require('../src/example-module');

describe('Example Module', () => {
    it('should return the correct result', () => {
        const result = exampleModule.someFunction(2, 3);
        assert.strictEqual(result, 5);
    });
});

```
